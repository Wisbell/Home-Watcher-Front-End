  <h2 class="about-title text-center">About Home Watcher</h2>
  <p>The idea for Home Watcher came about when I finished researching the capabilities of my Raspberry Pi after using it on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Wisbell/capstone-score-keeper-west">front-end capstone</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nashvillesoftwareschool.com">NSS</a>.  After deciding I could complete a minimum viable project in less than 2 weeks, I decided to start building. Below you can get a run down on how the app works, a list of github repos where each part of the project is located, a list of technologies used in the creation of the app, and my website where you can contact me (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/westley-isbell/">Westley Isbell</a>)</p>

    <div class="panel-heading">How it Works</div>
    <div class="panel-body">First: The motion sensor is calibrated and then triggered by movement</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Second: A picture is taken with the camera module and saved to the Raspberry Pi file system</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Third: The created picture file is then sent to AWS S3 for storage</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Fourth: A collection is created on a Mongo database with the url from AWS and the date/time it was created</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Fifth: The picture file is deleted from the Raspberry Pi file system</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Sixth: A flag variable is reset to allow another picture to be taken if motion is sensed</div>
    <div class="panel-body">Client-Side: After logging in a user can visit the recent route and see the most recent pictures generated by the Raspberry Pi system</div>
